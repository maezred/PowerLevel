PowerLevel
==========

## Overview

PowerLevel is a plugin for Bukkit/Spigot (a mod for Minecraft).

## Planned Features

  - Turns the level bar into more of a psuedo magic power bar.
  - Turns the dragon egg into an osmosis-style magic reserve.
  - As players accrue experience a certain amount is also added to the reserve regardless of its location in the world.
  - A player may own any number of dragon eggs, but they're all tied to the same reserve.
  - Certain actions, like mining will generally keep a player topped off in available power, but will not add much to the reserve.
  - Other actions, may drain your currently available power, but will add much more to the reserve.
  - The reserve will spawn XP that is only collectible by the owner.
  - The reserve will only fill your XP bar up to your maximum power.

  - Change the level requirements of vanilla minecraft enchantments.
  - Create higher tiers of enchantments.
  - Higher tiers can require a minimum reserve level to create a sense of progression.
  
  - Create potion boosters.
  - Makes potions stronger but costs power to craft and drink the potion.
  - More?
